# Unique-User-Identifier1

Since everyone moves differently and accelerometers are fast becoming ubiquitous, this competition is designed to investigate the feasibility of using accelerometer data as a biometric for identifying users of mobile devices.

## Model
Deep Learning model to classify unique users based on the pattern of initial accelerometer readings
Designed a sequence encoder using LSTM with accelorometer readingâ€™s as embedding vectors to achieve an accuracy of 81%
Incorporated variable batch length and packed padded sequence for efficient computation
